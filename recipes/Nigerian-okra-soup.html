    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Okra Soup is one of the quickest and easiest Nigerian soups to prepare.
      Some argue that a lot of work goes to the cutting of the two vegetables
      used in preparing this recipe. Yes but once the vegetables are ready; it
      cooks in no time at all.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups (250g) Okra</li>
      <li>3 cooking spoons red palm oil</li>
      <li>Beef: Best cut</li>
      <li>Shaki (Cow Triple) (Optional)</li>
      <li>Fish: Iced Fish (Mackerel/Titus), Dry Fish, Stock Fish</li>
      <li>1 Handful crayfish</li>
      <li>Pepper and Salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>Onions (optional)</li>
      <li>Vegetable: Nigerian pumpkin leaves or spinach (fresh or frozen)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Directions or Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If you will use shaki (cow tripe) for the soup, wash and boil till it is
        done. Add water sparingly because this soup needs to be thick. Add the
        soaked stockfish and dry fish to the cooked shaki. The length of time it
        will take to cook shaki depends on the cooking appliance utilized. You
        can take a bite to confirm this.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you are happy that the shaki and stock fish are well-done, add the
        beef, onions and stock cubes and cook till done. Then add the iced fish
        and cook till done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour red palm oil in another pot and heat the pot to dissolve the oil if
        it is congealed. Add the diced okra and start frying to kick-start the
        drawing process, add some meat stock from time to time till you notice
        the okra start to draw. This process should take a maximum of 5 mins to
        avoid over-cooking the okra.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the vegetable and stir well. Add all the meat and fish,
        crayfish, pepper and salt to taste. Then stir well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the cooking pot and leave to simmer and it is ready to be served.
      </li>
